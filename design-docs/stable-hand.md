## Stable Hand

#### *"A stable hand for stable hands"*

<br>

#####The Objective
Design and develop a site promoting a task app for stable hands 

##### The Concept
Clean and simple and equestrian-inspired (no hunting horns tho!)
Movement is a big part of being around horses, so should have a looping video somewhere (maybe artsy, of wind blowing through mane? or sawdust blowing across a barn floor?)
Any dynamic features should be very smooth to appeal to and avoid alarming folks sensitve to tiny movements


##### The Hope
Convey sense of familiarity with simple design able to scale well on a mobile device (since Stable Hand is a mobile app)
Convince user that company is knowledgeable of the domain and not just a tech company
Show visitor a world with and without Stable Hand and help them help themselves decide which one to live in (the SH one)
