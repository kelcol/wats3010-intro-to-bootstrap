## Stable Hand

#### *"A stable hand for stable hands"*

<br>

##### Site Objective
Stable Hand is a mobile and web application that allows stable workers to carry out routine barn tasks in a more organized fashion. It integrates with barn management software from other providers. Integration allows barn managers to send notifications and updates to Stable Hand users.

##### Design Concept
Site should be clean, simple, and equestrian-inspired. This site will serve to promote Stable Hand and link to the corresponding web applicaiton for the mobile app. There should be a prominently displayed login button to conduct existing users off site to the Stable Hand web application. Users should be able to distinguish promotional/support site from application site, and know they are connected but distinct.


##### Site Ambition
Site should convey that the creators have an understanding of the world occupied by current and potential users. Convince users by giving them an experience on the promotional site they can infer will be similar to how they experience using the product. Show visitor a world with and without Stable Hand and help them help themselves to decide which one to live in (the SH one).


##### Sites Referenced for Inspiration
[Demo Site for horse biz](https://www.templatemonster.com/demo/61369.html)

* demo site for a bootstrap site template 
* makes a good effort to represent content for demo purposes
* I like that all site pages are inventoried when you hover over "Pages" in main nav bar


[iStable](http://www.istable.com/)

* explainer video and customer feedback featured on launch page
* think the dropdown menus in nav bar should use more contrasting colors


[Stable Secretary](http://stablesecretary.com/) 

* well organized and informative launch page
* lots of screenshots
* main nav bar is spare but bottom nav contains many additional links

[Horse Notes](http://horsenotes.co/)

* Not crazy about having to hover over icons in feature carousel to learn more about them
* Some of the text is hard to read due to size and color
* limited amount of product information available
* feels like the intention of site is to shuttle users to app stores (where some additional product information not on site is availble)
* there are some deadends in the form of "Coming soon!" pages I think are discouraging to users
